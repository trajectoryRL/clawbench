# Inbox Processing Rules (learned preferences)

## Classification Shortcuts
- Emails from Elena Rodriguez (CEO) → always urgent, reply same day
- Emails from Acme Corp (@acmecorp.com) → client, reply within 4 hours
- Emails from Sarah Kim (manager) → high priority, handle before standup
- Subject contains "CONFIDENTIAL" or "confidential" → do NOT summarize, do NOT create tasks
- Sender ends in @newsletter or subject says "digest" → archive, batch for weekend

## Recent Decisions
- 2026-02-04: Alex approved auto-archiving vendor promos without review
- 2026-02-03: Alex prefers task creation in Linear over email follow-up threads
- 2026-02-03: Scheduling requests should check calendar first, propose 2 options

## Draft Style Notes
- External replies: "Best, Alex"
- Internal replies: "— Alex"
- Quick acks: no sign-off needed
- Never exceed 100 words unless topic demands it
